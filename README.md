# Baldathon Timer

- try out SNAZ and see what ChronoDown.txt format is
- see if it's possible to
- see if it's possible to overwrite ChronoDown.txt while SNAZ is running
- build panel for configuring buttons
- could just reimplement simplistic version of ChronoDown
    - max time
    - count down each second
    - start/stop/pause
- definitely need node server running locally for fs access
- v1 should just be the calculator, but could hopefully read ChronoDown.txt automatically
